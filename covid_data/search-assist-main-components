## Main Components

### 1. Index Selection
- Displays available indexes from Elasticsearch
- Uses segmented buttons or tabs for selection based on the number of indexes

### 2. Search Interface
- Text input for search queries
- Buttons for selecting search type (Entity, Text, Vector)

### 3. Results Display
- Shows search results in a Streamlit dataframe
- Provides options for summarizing and interacting with the data

### 4. AI-Powered Features
- `summarize_df`: Generates insights from the dataset using an AI model
- `converse_with_data`: Allows users to ask questions about the data in natural language

### 5. Retrieval System
- Uses a combination of BM25 and vector retrieval for efficient searching
- Implements an ensemble retriever for improved results

## Key Functions

- `get_indices()`: Retrieves available Elasticsearch indexes
- `add_footer()`: Adds a footer with a link to Kibana for more detailed results
- `show()`: Main function that sets up the Streamlit interface and handles user interactions

## Customization
- Modify the `template` in `summarize_df` and `converse_with_data` to adjust the AI's behavior
- Adjust the weights in the ensemble retriever to fine-tune search results
